# Sorting-Algorithms-analysis
Project name: Sorting Algorithms analysis
Programming language/Software: C++, Dev.++
Date: Nov-Dec 2019
Description: study how the theoretical analysis of a variety of sorting algorithms compares with their actual performance. The sorting algorithms you will study are (Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap Sort), then design and implement an efficient algorithm that, given a set S of n integers and another integer x, determines whether or not there exist two elements in S whose sum is exactly x.
